# ch 6 Song of Heroku  

*Please sing this song with the tempo of **Mother**(THE WALL - PINK FLOYD)*
###Heroku 

Heroku, do you think they'll create an account?
Heroku, do you think they'll like the repository?
Heroku, do you think they'll try to receive my git push?
Ooh, aah, Heroku, should I buildpack the app?

Heroku, should I run for web5.py?
Heroku, should I trust the tutorial?
Heroku, will they put app in the shell?
Ooh, aah, is it just a waste of time?

Hush now, baby baby,don't you cry
Heroku's gonna make all of your apps respond to command
Heroku's gonna put all of Procfile to open yourapp
Heroku's gonna keep the requirements.txt right here installed 
it won't let the browser open but it might let the app runs locally
Heroku's gonna keep the branch clean and Everything up-to-date

Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh,babe
of course Heroku's gonna help setting the buildpack value

Heroku, do you think this app's good enough?(for me)
Heroku, do you think this app's suitable?(to me)
Heroku, will it crash your apps apart?
Ooh, aah, Heroku,will it break my heart?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Heroku's gonna check out all your git commands for you
Heroku won't let anyone uncommit get through
Heroku's gonna wait up till you deploy the app
Heroku will always find out the changes to the repository
Heroku's gonna keep app load and open

Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh,babe
you'll always be an  good app to me

Heroku, did errors need to be so many?
